        <p>Hello readers,</p>
        <p>My name is Krishna Verma, and this site was created by myself for... fun ig ;)</p>
        <p>Jokes aside, this is my first WebD project which is created using HTML and CSS only. No Javascript or any other language was used for making this website. This is simply an assignent given to me by my WebD teacher.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>
            Something about myself...
        </p>
        <p>
            Once again my name is Krishna. <br>
            I am currently pursuing my B.Tech in Information Technology from NIT Kurukshetra. <br>
            I am currently in my first year (as of 9th February, 2024). <br>
            My area of interest are Web Designing, Cloud Computing, Ethical Hacking and many more.
        </p>
        <p>
            Please ignore any of my mistakes and enjoy my website, though there is nothing enjoyable in this website. :)

        <p>
            Thank You!
